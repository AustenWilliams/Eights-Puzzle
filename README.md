# Eights-Puzzle
## Implemented search algorithms to solve MODIFIED 8-puzzle:

My first assignment for Foundations of AI in which I had to design an algorithm to solve the classic Eights Puzzle problem. I did this by immplementing Breadth-First search, Depth-First search, Uniform-Cost search, Greedy Best First Search, and A* search. Each search is designed to use have a succesor function and some use heuristics.
